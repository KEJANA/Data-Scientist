# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

> A Machine Learning web application that predicts the probability of heart disease using Logistic Regression based on clinical health parameters.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to develop heart disease using historical medical data.  
The model is built using the Logistic Regression algorithm, a widely used classification technique in healthcare analytics due to its simplicity and strong baseline performance.

The trained model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application that allows users to input patient health details and instantly obtain prediction results.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict heart disease risk using clinical features  
- Build a reliable Logistic Regression classification model  
- Provide real-time prediction through a user-friendly interface  
- Assist early medical risk assessment using machine learning

## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm
### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a supervised classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes (Yes/No, Disease/No Disease).

Why Logistic Regression?
- Efficient and fast model training  
- Works well for medical binary classification problems  
- Provides probability-based predictions  
- Easy to interpret model coefficients

## 📊 Dataset Details
The model uses structured medical attributes such as:

- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Resting ECG  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- Exercise Induced Angina  
- Oldpeak (ST depression)  
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment  

These features help determine the likelihood of heart disease.
