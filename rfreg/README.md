## 🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm
### Random Forest Regression

Random Forest is an ensemble method that:
- Builds multiple decision trees  
- Aggregates their predictions  
- Improves accuracy and generalization  

### Why Random Forest?
- Handles non-linear relationships effectively  
- Reduces overfitting compared to single decision tree  
- Works well with both small and large datasets  
- High prediction accuracy

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of structured numerical and categorical input features used to predict a continuous target variable such as:
- House Prices
- Sales Forecast
- Demand Prediction
- Market Trends

The model learns complex relationships between input variables and the target output.
